"""PROBLEM:
Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove k digits from the number so that the new number 
is the smallest possible.

Note:
The length of num is less than 10002 and will be â‰¥ k.
The given num does not contain any leading zero.
Example 1:

Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
Output: "1219"
Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.
"""

"""SOLUTION: Asked in Micrsoft onsite.
Use a stack to tak care of the case when all the numbers are increasing.
