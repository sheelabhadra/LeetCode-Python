# Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.

# A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

# Example:

# X X X X
# X O O X
# X X O X
# X O X X
# After running your function, the board should be:

# X X X X
# X X X X
# X X X X
# X O X X
# Explanation:
# Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border of the board 
# are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border
# will be flipped to 'X'. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.


## SOLUTION: Only check the boundaries. If there is a "O" on the boundary then run DFS and convert
# all "O"s connected to it to "Y"s. Then iterate through the board again and convert all the "O"s
# to "X"s and "Y"s to "O"s.
